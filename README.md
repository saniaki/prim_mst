# Prim's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph
The algorithm is heap based version of the Prim's algorithm. The input file file describes an undirected graph with integer edge costs.  It has the format <br/>
<br/>
    [number_of_nodes] [number_of_edges] <br/>
    [one_node_of_edge_1] [other_node_of_edge_1] [edge_1_cost]<br/>
    [one_node_of_edge_2] [other_node_of_edge_2] [edge_2_cost] <br/>
    ...
